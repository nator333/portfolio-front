The previous AI engineer effectively tackled a complex, multi-stage task, starting with a vague dependency update request on a seemingly empty repository. The key was the AI engineer's iterative problem-solving approach, adapting to new information (GitHub repository link from user) and persistent technical challenges (Node.js/Angular 7 compatibility, OpenSSL errors, peer dependency conflicts). The engineer demonstrated diligence in providing detailed explanations, multiple solution options, and specific scripts/commands for the user, especially when encountering environment-specific issues like the Mac-related OpenSSL error. The ability to identify underlying compatibility issues and offer both quick fixes and permanent solutions was crucial. The engineer also diligently prepared PR-related documentation, despite not being able to execute the PR directly.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to Update all the dependencies for an existing application. However, the initial codebase provided was minimal. The user then clarified that the work pertains to an Angular portfolio frontend project, providing a GitHub link to  and . The core problem was to update this old Angular 7 project's dependencies while ensuring the profile site works as before. This evolved into a multi-step process including:
1.  **Dependency Updates**: Updating Angular 7 project dependencies () to modern, compatible versions, addressing issues like , ,  (migrated to ).
2.  **Node.js Upgrade**: Upgrading the Node.js version from an older version (likely Node 10.x, as Angular 7 requires) to a more recent LTS version (Node.js 18.x) while maintaining Angular 7 compatibility.
3.  **Compatibility Fixes**: Resolving various compatibility issues arising from the updates, specifically Unknown command: "ERESOLVE"

To see a list of supported npm commands, run:
  npm help (peer dependency conflicts, particularly with RxJS and ) and  (OpenSSL issues with Node.js 18 and older Webpack versions). The ultimate goal was a functional Angular 7 portfolio site on Node.js 18.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Angular 7**: Legacy frontend framework.
-   **Node.js (18 LTS, 22 LTS)**: JavaScript runtime environment, with focus on compatibility with older Angular.
-   **Yarn/npm**: Package managers for Node.js dependencies, dealing with  errors.
-   **Webpack/OpenSSL**: Underlying build tools and cryptographic libraries causing compatibility issues ().
-   **RxJS**: Reactive programming library, specifically  version conflicts.
-   **Sass (Dart Sass)**: CSS pre-processor, migration from  due to architecture compatibility.
-   **File Watchers (ENOSPC)**: Linux system limit issue during development server runtime.
-   ****: npm flag for permissive dependency resolution.
-   ****: Node.js flag to enable legacy OpenSSL algorithms.

**Key Files and Changes:**

*   ****: This file is central. It initially contained Angular 7 dependencies. The AI engineer significantly modified it multiple times to:
    *   Update various Angular-related dependencies (, , , , , ).
    *   Introduce  as a dependency and remove .
    *   Modify  section to include  for , , , , and  commands to resolve OpenSSL errors.
    *   Set  for Node.js and npm versions.
    *   A  and  version were created during initial update attempts.  and  versions were also created as templates for specific fixes.
*   ****: Modified to fix  import issues, specifically changing  to correctly use .
*   ****: An empty lockfile initially. It was regenerated multiple times during yarn install v1.22.22

<pending_tasks>
-   User needs to execute the provided scripts ( and  or manual commands) on their local machine to:
    -   Create a Pull Request to the GitHub repository.
    -   Apply the Node.js 18 LTS upgrade.
    -   Apply the final OpenSSL compatibility fix.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving the  error encountered by the user after successfully attempting to upgrade Node.js to version 18 LTS and fixing dependency conflicts (). This OpenSSL error is a known compatibility issue between Node.js 18 (which uses OpenSSL 3.0) and older Angular 7 projects (which use older Webpack versions requiring legacy OpenSSL algorithms).

The AI engineer provided several solutions specifically tailored for Mac users (as explicitly requested by the user):
1.  **Quick Terminal Fix**:  followed by .
2.  **Permanent Project Fix (package.json)**: Modifying the  section in  to prepend  to all  commands.
3.  **Project-Specific .env File**: Adding  to a  file in the project root.
4.  ** with Flag**: Using .

A comprehensive Mac-specific script (üçé Mac OpenSSL Fix for Portfolio (Node.js 18 + Angular 7)
=======================================================
‚ùå Error: package.json not found
Please run this script from your portfolio directory) was also created to automate the  update. The AI engineer re-emphasized the fastest solution for the user to try () and then proceed with the permanent  update. The portfolio application is expected to be functional and building correctly with Node.js 18 LTS after this fix.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to wait for the user to confirm whether the suggested OpenSSL fix (specifically the Mac-specific options) successfully resolves the issue and allows the Angular application to run.
